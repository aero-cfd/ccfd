# CCFD

A two-dimensional finite volume computational fluid dynamics code, written in C

This code will eventually become a drop-in replacement for `cfdfv`, a CFD code written in Fortran by the [Institute of Aerodynamics and Gas Dynamics](http://www.iag.uni-stuttgart.de) at the University of Stuttgart for a CFD programming course. This code itself is not available online, as far as I know, but it is a simplified version of [FLEXI](https://www.flexi-project.org/).

## First Step

As a first step I want to recreate the SOD test case. The program output should be the same as the one from `cfdfv`, as well as the calculation output.
