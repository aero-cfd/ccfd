# ccfd
A two-dimensional finite volume computational fluid dynamics code, written in C

This code will eventually become a drop-in replacement for `cfdfv`, a CFD code written in Fortran by the Institute of Aerodynamics and Gas Dynamics at the University of Stuttgart for a CFD programming course. This code itself is not available online, as far as I know, but it is a simplified version of [FLEXI](https://github.com/flexi-framework/flexi).
